# PAC-MAN

This is just a little proof of concept thing I'm working on...

## How to set up

1. Download and install npm v. 4.0.6 exactly
2. Make sure maven is moved to where PAC-MAN can find it: /opt/PAC-MAN/apache-maven-3.5.4/bin

Just kidding. Just download or clone or whatever and open up index.html
